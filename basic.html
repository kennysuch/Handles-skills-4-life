        <p class="paragraph">To warm up, begin by pounding both balls at the same time at a little above waist height. Make sure that you are in an athletic position as shown in the two pictures above. Continue pounding the balls above waist height for about 20 seconds, then switch to dribbling at your knees. After another 20 seconds, switch to dribbling the balls at your ankles for 20 seconds. Repeat this again in any order you want.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Next, begin dribbling both balls from side-to-side in front of you in sync. Then do this alternating. After, dribble both balls on your side from front-to-back. Alternate between these reps of 20 seconds.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Basic Zig-Zag Drills- Hold one ball like a football in one hand and have one ball ready to dribble. For the first round, you should be doing crossovers. Second round, do a through the legs. Third, do a behind the back. Take one dribble to your right, and do the move while switching the held ball to the other hand. Explode to your left taking one dribble. Do the move again and explode right. Do this drill for a court length and then head back.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Around One Leg- Dribble one ball stationary and the other ball around one leg. Alternate sides.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Crossover Juggle- Crossover with one ball and toss the other ball to the other hand. Repeat. Do this quickly for about 15 seconds. Then change sides.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Two Ball Attack Behind the Back Drill- The player will start on the baseline with a basketball in each hand. They will start to dribble both basketballs at the same time. When the drill starts they will move forward up the floor and make a behind the back with one ball and a crossover with the other ball at the same time at the free throw line, half court, and opposite free throw line (alternate which hand makes the move each time). After each move they need to push the basketballs out in front of them, simulating getting past the defender. When they reach the opposite baseline they will turn around and come back.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Two Ball Attack Through the Legs Drill- The player will start on the baseline with a basketball in each hand. They will start to dribble both basketballs at the same time. When the drill starts they will move forward up the floor and make a through the legs move with one ball and a crossover with the other ball at the same time at the free throw line, half court, and opposite free throw line (alternate which hand makes the move each time). After each move they need to push the basketballs out in front of them, simulating getting past the defender. When they reach the opposite baseline they will turn around and come back.</p>

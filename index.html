    <h1> <b>Double Ball-Handling</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="paragraph">As a basketball player, your ball-handling can always use work. The most effective way to work on both hands at once, especially your weaker side, is doing drills that involve handling two balls, like <i>Steph Curry</i> and other great guards of our time practice. This is what you need to do to get your game to the next level and improve exponentially, even after the 1<sup>st</sup> day. When starting off with two balls, it will definitely take some getting used to, but if you develop a great control over two basketballs, imagine what you will be able to do on the court with one. </p><img src="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/pisiy5/picture9654680/ALTERNATES/FREE_960/Curry.JPG" id="stephcurry">

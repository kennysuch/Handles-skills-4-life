    <p class="paragraph">As a basketball player, your ball-handling can always use work. The most effective way to work on both hands at once, especially your weaker side, is doing drills that involve handling two balls like <i>Steph Curry</i> and other great guards of our time practice. This is what you need to do to get your game to the next level and improve exponentially, even after the 1<sup>st</sup> day. When starting off with two balls, it will definitely take some getting used to, but if you develop a great control over two basketballs, imagine what you will be able to do on the court with one. </p><img src="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/pisiy5/picture9654680/ALTERNATES/FREE_960/Curry.JPG" id="stephcurry">

    <p class="paragraph">To warm up, begin by pounding both balls at the same time at a little above waist height. Make sure that you are in an athletic position as shown in the two pictures above. Continue pounding the balls above waist height for about 20 seconds, then switch to dribbling at your knees. After another 20 seconds, switch to dribbling the balls at your ankles for 20 seconds. Repeat this again in any order you want.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Next, begin dribbling both balls from side-to-side in sync. Then dribble both balls on your side from front-to-back. Alternate between these twice for lengths of 20 seconds.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">As a basketball player, your ball-handling can always use work. The most effective way to work on both hands at once, especially your weaker side, is doing drills that involve handling two balls like <i>Steph Curry</i> and other great guards of our time practice. This is what you need to do to get your game to the next level and improve exponentially, even after the 1<sup>st</sup> day. When starting off with two balls, it will definitely take some getting used to, but if you develop a great control over two basketballs, imagine what you will be able to do on the court with one. </p><img src="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/pisiy5/picture9654680/ALTERNATES/FREE_960/Curry.JPG" id="stephcurry">

    <h3>For demonstrations of drills watch videos.</h3>

    <h3 id="Basic">Double Ball Dribbling Drills (basic)</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">To warm up, begin by pounding both balls at the same time at a little above waist height. Make sure that you are in an athletic position as shown in the two pictures above. Continue pounding the balls above waist height for about 20 seconds, then switch to dribbling at your knees. After another 20 seconds, switch to dribbling the balls at your ankles for 20 seconds. Repeat this again in any order you want.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Next, begin dribbling both balls from side-to-side in front of you in sync. Then do this alternating. After, dribble both balls on your side from front-to-back. Alternate between these reps of 20 seconds.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Basic Zig-Zag Drills- Hold one ball like a football in one hand and have one ball ready to dribble. For the first round, you should be doing crossovers. Second round, do a through the legs. Third, do a behind the back. Take one dribble to your right, and do the move while switching the held ball to the other hand. Then explode to your left and do the move again and face left. Do this drill for a court length and then head back.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Around One Leg- Dribble one ball stationary and the other ball around one leg. Alternate sides.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Crossover Juggle- Crossover with one ball and toss the other ball to the other hand. Do this quickly for about 15 seconds. Then change sides.</p>

    <h3 id="Advanced">Double Ball Dribbling Drills (advanced)</h3>
    
    <p class="paragraph">The 2 ball bounce between the legs crossover, behind the back crossover, and the double crossover basketball dribbling drills are really advanced drills, but they will help you work on strengthening both hands at the same time, developing quicker hands, and working on the between the legs, behind the back, and crossover move. This may not be the first two ball dribbling drill you do, but once you have mastered a few of the other two ball dribbling drills this is a great drill to test your skills on. It is important that you are always challenging yourself as a player and pushing yourself to get better on a regular basis. You can either practice this stationary or during a zig-zag drill.</p>

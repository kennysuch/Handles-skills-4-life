        <p class="paragraph">As a basketball player, your ball-handling can always use work. The most effective way to work on both hands at once, especially your weaker side, is doing drills that involve handling two balls like Steph Curry and other great guards of our time practice. Two ball dribbling is what you need to do to get your game to the next level and improve exponentially, even after the 1<sup>st</sup> day. When starting off with two balls, it will take some getting used to, but if you develop great control over two basketballs, imagine what you will be able to do on the basketball court with one. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Keep your eyes up when dribbling the basketball. Pound the ball as hard as you can to perform every drill as fast as you can. Do not be discouraged if you mess up. Who cares if you do? Being a good ball handler is not all about being able to break someones ankles. It is about being able to handle the ball and see the floor to find open teammates and make the right play. Stay low and keep your dribbles tight to your body, you always want to protect the basketballs</p>
